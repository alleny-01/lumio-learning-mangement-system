- **Auto-Advance & Completion**: Interactive "Up Next" card with hover state and automated lesson completion tracking.

### 🛠️ Instructor Studio (Course Builder)
- **Step 1: Course Overview**: Set course title, category, difficulty, thumbnail file upload to Supabase storage, preview video link, course description, and up to 6 "What you'll learn" outcome fields with add/delete controls.
- **Step 2: Modules & Lessons**: Drag-and-drop style module reordering, lesson creation (title, YouTube URL, duration in minutes, core concept), and resource attachments.
- **Publishing & Duplication**: Support for `draft`, `saved`, and `published` course status transitions, as well as single-click course duplication.

### ⚙️ User Settings
- **Profile Customization**: Update first name, last name, bio, and Date of Birth with a mobile-optimized layout. Upload and remove avatar images powered by Supabase storage (`avatars` bucket).
- **Account & Security**: Auth provider status badge (Email vs Google OAuth), password update form, and account deletion confirmation flow.

## 🗄️ Database & Storage Architecture (Supabase)

Lumio utilizes Supabase for authentication, relational data storage, and file hosting.

### SQL Tables
- `profiles`: Extends `auth.users` with `first_name`, `last_name`, `avatar_url`, `bio`, `date_of_birth`.
- `courses`: Stores course metadata, `instructor_id`, `category`, `difficulty`, `status` (`draft`, `saved`, `published`), `learning_outcomes`, `thumbnail_url`, `preview_video_url`.
- `course_modules`: Modules belonging to courses (`sort_order`, `title`).
- `lessons`: Lessons within modules (`title`, `youtube_url`, `duration_minutes`, `core_concept`, `sort_order`).
- `enrollments`: Maps users to enrolled courses (`enrolled_at`, `progress_percent`).
- `user_lesson_progress`: Track completed lessons per user (`completed_at`).
- `user_study_activity`: Logs daily study sessions and minutes for analytics.
- `lesson_resources`: Stores downloadable resources attached to lessons (`file_name`, `file_path`, `file_size`, `resource_kind`).

### Storage Buckets
Create the following public storage buckets in Supabase Storage:
1. `course-thumbnails` (Public)
2. `course-resources` (Public)
3. `avatars` (Public)

Vercel will build the project using `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) and output the static SPA bundle ready for production edge distribution.
